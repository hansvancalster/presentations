## What's this all about?

An evolution from:

- r-scripts in `.R` files

--

- to `Rmarkdown` and `bookdown`
    - scripts to documented scripts (literate programming)
    - learn to avoid copy-paste
        - write functions
        - use `purrr`
        - use parent-child documents

--

But data-analysis and reporting is better decoupled

--

- markdowns with heavy calculations
    - long runtime
        - chunk option `cache = TRUE`, but can be tricky
    - (too) big objects in the R environment

---

## Enter `drake`

- analysis pipeline comes first and is followed by reporting
    - reporting can be integrated in the 'pipeline' as a last step (`knitr_in()` function)
    - or completely separated (for instance in a different R project)

- stimulates to work with functions as much as possible


--

Short intro to the `drake` package: https://books.ropensci.org/drake/index.html#short-version

```{r out.height="20%", out.width="20%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "drake_hex_logo.svg")
```


---

## Simple workflow

1. `drake_plan()`

2. `make()`

3. in case of errors `diagnose()`

4. access the targets with `readd()` or `loadd()` and check them

5. change the plan in 1.

6. go to 2.

---

## Project structure for more complicated workflows

````
|- prj_drake
|    |- prj_drake.Rproj
|    |- run.R
|    |- _drake.R
|    |- R
|    |    |- plan.R # the workflow containing all targets that need to be calculated
|    |    |- functions_*.R # all functions that are needed
|    |    |- packages.R # all packages that are needed
````

Example _drake.R:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
source("R/packages.R")
source("R/functions.R")
source("R/plan.R")
# options(clustermq.scheduler = "multicore") # optional parallel computing
drake_config(plan, verbose = 2)
```

---

## Continued

Example run.R:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(drake)
r_outdated()

r_make()

r_outdated()

library(visNetwork) # so the graph renders
r_vis_drake_graph()
```

`r_make()` and other `r_*` will call _drake.R

## Scale-up your work

---

## Static branching: map(), cross() and combine()

```{r echo=TRUE}
numlet <- function(numbers, letters) {
  paste0(numbers, letters)
}

plan <- drake_plan(
  trace = TRUE,
  crossed_targets = target(
    numlet(numbers, letters),
    transform = cross(
      numbers = c(1, 2),
      letters = c("a", "b")
    )),
    mapped_targets = target(
    numlet(numbers, letters),
    transform = map(
      numbers = c(1, 2),
      letters = c("a", "b")
    )),
  combined_targets = target(
    paste0(crossed_targets),
    transform = combine(crossed_targets)
  )
)
```

---

```{r}
vis_drake_graph(config = drake_config(plan))
```

---

## Dynamic branching

>Dynamic branching is an interface to declare new targets while `make()` is running. It lets you create more compact plans and graphs, it is easier to use than static branching, and it improves the startup speed of `make()` and friends.

https://books.ropensci.org/drake/dynamic.html#which-kind-of-branching-should-i-use

- `map()`

- `cross()`

- `group()`

- during testing, use `make(plan, max_expand = 2)` to limit the number of dynamic targets

---

## Memory management

- when developing a drake pipeline: 
    - monitor memory usage
    - balance the number of cores to use against memory
    - https://books.ropensci.org/drake/memory.html

---

## What else?

- specialized output formats for targets: https://books.ropensci.org/drake/storage.html

- `which_clean()` and `clean()` function: check and clean cached targets (so you can force rebuilding targets if a change happened upstream that drake cannot detect)

- `cached()` function: lists targets in the cache

- multiple caches: create one with `new_cache()`

---

## What else?

- integration with git
    - the `.cache` folder is `gitignored`
    - `make(cache_log_file = TRUE)` -> creates a csv log file with hashes for each target. This file should be put under version control
    - drake also has a recovery feature
    
- integration with `docker`: 
    - drake outside docker: https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/Docker-psock
    - drake inside docker: https://gitlab.com/ecohealthalliance/drake-gitlab-docker-example

- integration with `renv`:https://github.com/rstudio/renv
    - ensures everyone will work with the same versions of R packages

- integration in a package: https://books.ropensci.org/drake/projects.html#workflows-as-r-packages
